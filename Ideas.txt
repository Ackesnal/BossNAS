1.  Apply NAS on multimodal tasks
    Details to be discussed
    Changlin: Vision Transformer can be a prospect
    
2. Introduce Mutual Information Maximazation (MIM) into Unsupervised Learning NAS

3. Use Graph Neural Networks to supernet. Regard the whole supernet as a graph, search the best way on supernet

4. Use A* algorithm for searching?

5. Why DNA used DFS, but BossNAS turned back to evolutionary algorithm? Since BossNAS adopts block-wise training, the DFS should also work?
